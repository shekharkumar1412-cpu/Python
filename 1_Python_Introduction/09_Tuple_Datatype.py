# Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. 
# The only difference is that tuples are immutable. 
# Tuples once created cannot be modified.
# In Python, we use the parentheses () to store items of a tuple.


# create a tuple 
product = ('Microsoft', 'Xbox', 499.99, 33)

# access element at index 0
print(product[0])  

# access element at index 1
print(product[1])   


# access element at index 2
print(product[2])


# access element at index 3
print(product[3])
