# In Python programming, the pass statement is a null statement 
            # which can be used as a placeholder for future code.
# Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future.
                        # In such cases, we can use the pass statement.




# Using pass with conditional statement 

n = 11

# use pass inside if statement
if n > 10:
    pass            # here inside the if we want to write the code later on 
                        # so for now on by just writing the pass statement our rest of the program will run fine 

print('Hello')


n = 10

if n > 10:
    # write code later          # Here we had written a comment inside the if which is completely ignored by the
                                    # intrepretar hence throwing a error msg

print('Hello')
