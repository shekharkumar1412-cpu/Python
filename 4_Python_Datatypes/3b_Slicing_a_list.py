# In Python it is possible to access a section of items from the list 
# using the slicing operator (:) not just a single item. 

# When we slice lists, the start index is inclusive but the end index is exclusive.

my_list = ['p','r','o','g','r','a','m','i','z']

# items from index 2 to index 4
print(my_list[2:5])

# items from index 5 to end
print(my_list[5:])

# items beginning to end
print(my_list[:])
