An exception is an unexpected event that occurs during program execution. 
For example, divide_by_zero = 7 / 0 this will create an error as we can't divide a number by 0

                    
                        
                                # Python Logical Errors (Exceptions)

Errors that occur at runtime (after passing the syntax test) are called exceptions or logical errors.

For instance, they occur when we
=> try to open a file(for reading) that does not exist (FileNotFoundError)
=> try to divide a number by zero (ZeroDivisionError)
=> try to import a module that does not exist (ImportError) and so on.

% Whenever these types of runtime errors occur, Python creates an exception object.
#  If not handled properly, it prints a traceback to that error 
                         along with some details about why that error occurred.
