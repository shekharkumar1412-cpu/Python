                         # Python Built-in Exceptions

Illegal operations can raise exceptions. There are plenty of built-in exceptions in Python
 that are raised when corresponding errors occur.

We can view all the built-in exceptions using the built-in local() function as follows:
  print(dir(locals()['__builtins__']))

=>  Here, locals()['__builtins__'] will return a module of built-in exceptions, 
functions, and attributes and dir allows us to list these attributes as strings.

List of common built-in exceptions in Python programming along with the error that cause them 


Exception	         Cause of Error
AssertionError	    Raised when an assert statement fails.
AttributeError	    Raised when attribute assignment or reference fails.
EOFError	        Raised when the input() function hits end-of-file condition.
FloatingPointError	Raised when a floating point operation fails.
GeneratorExit	    Raise when a generator's close() method is called.
ImportError	        Raised when the imported module is not found.
IndexError	        Raised when the index of a sequence is out of range.
KeyError	        Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.
KeyboardInterrupt	Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (Ctrl+C or Delete).
MemoryError	        Raised when an operation runs out of memory.
NameError	        Raised when a variable is not found in local or global scope.
NotImplementedError	Raised by abstract methods.
OSError	            Raised when system operation causes system related error.
OverflowError	    Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented.
ReferenceError	    Raised when a weak reference proxy is used to access a garbage collected referent.
RuntimeError	    Raised when an error does not fall under any other category.
StopIteration	    Raised by next() function to indicate that there is no further item to be returned by iterator.
SyntaxError	        Raised by parser when syntax error is encountered.
IndentationError	Raised when there is incorrect indentation.
TabError	        Raised when indentation consists of inconsistent tabs and spaces.
SystemError	        Raised when interpreter detects internal error.
SystemExit	        Raised by sys.exit() function.
TypeError	        Raised when a function or operation is applied to an object of incorrect type.
UnboundLocalError	Raised when a reference is made to a local variable in a function or method, but no value has been bound to that variable.
UnicodeError	    Raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs.
UnicodeEncodeError	Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during encoding.
UnicodeDecodeError	Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during decoding.
UnicodeTranslateError	Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during translating.
ValueError	        Raised when a function gets an argument of correct type but improper value.
ZeroDivisionError	Raised when the second operand of division or modulo operation is zero.

If required, we can also define our own exceptions(user_defined exceptions) in Python.

We can handle these built-in and user-defined exceptions in Python using 
try, except and finally statements.

Python Error and Exception
Errors represent conditions such as compilation error, syntax error, error in the logical part of the code, library incompatibility, infinite recursion, etc.

Errors are usually beyond the control of the programmer and we should not try to handle errors.

Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program.
